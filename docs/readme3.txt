Notes: 
-When running the app we've come across this issue with google play related services 
forcing an app restart due to an update, but then it does not restart the app. If 
this occurs it usually happens during the data download/saving process. We've found 
that updating Google Play Services on the emulator resolves this issue, or at 
the very least, greatly reduces its frequency. The update can be performed by 
holding left click on the google play app -> clicking "my apps" in the pop up -> 
then click 'update' besides 'Google Play services' (the inspection data app needs to 
have been loaded once to bypass the google play store asking you to sign in when 
"my apps" is clicked). 

-code reviews were carried out by the repo manager, unless repo manager submitted
the merge request in which case another team member checked the code
